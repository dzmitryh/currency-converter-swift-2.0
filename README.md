Currency Converter

Was forked from mayankk2308/currency-converter-swift-2.0 thanks this guy for the sufficient skeleton app!

Description:
The Currency Converter iOS app is a simple, fast, and efficient way of converting from one input currency to the three destination curreinces. The app also features ‘Associations’, allowing users to associate their conversions for future reference. The conversion interface is the initial view of the app, in the Convert tab. The app stores saved conversions along with its associations and displays them in the History tab.

My customization adds calculator opportunities to the forked functionality.

Check out some screens:
